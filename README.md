Bluewave — The Human Presence Layer on TON

Bluewave is a Telegram Mini App that verifies and rewards real human presence through AI-driven behavioral scoring.

It filters out bots, identifies genuine human interactions, and introduces a new category of infrastructure on TON: Presence Mining — where real activity becomes value.

Bluewave provides the foundation for brokers, prop firms, and Web3 applications to build trust, engagement, and rewards based on verified human presence.

🚀 Current Features

Presence Missions (daily tasks that detect human behavior)

Anti-Farm Timing Logic (identifies bots through reaction patterns)

Referral System

Country Presence Map (global presence signals)

Leaderboard & Rankings

Streak System

Points Engine (off-chain)

Supabase backend integration

AI PvP verification logic (backend private for security)

These features make Bluewave one of the first presence-based infrastructures inside the TON ecosystem.

🧠 Why Bluewave

Web3 is suffering from:

Bots farming missions

Fake engagement

Low human verification

Unreliable analytics

Lack of presence-based scoring for real users

Bluewave solves these by introducing:

HumanScore

PresenceScore

StreakScore

Each user’s activity is validated through timing, interaction behavior, and mission depth — allowing apps to distinguish humans from bots.

🧩 System Architecture
1. Mini App (Frontend)

Framework: Next.js + React
Capabilities:

Mission execution

Presence detection

Country detection

Leaderboard rendering

Referral UI

Global presence signals

2. Backend (Private)

Tech stack: Python + Aiogram, Supabase
Modules:

Reward engine

Mission engine

Anti-farm logic

HumanScore processor

Referral engine

Country signal detection

Backend is kept private to protect the anti-bot system and infrastructure logic.

3. Presence Ledger (Arriving Q1 2026)

Will display real-time analytics:

Daily Active Users

Monthly Active Users

Mission counts

Presence depth

Country rankings

Streak analytics

HumanScore distribution

This becomes TON’s first Presence Analytics Layer.

4. Bluewave SDK (Arriving Q2 2026)

Will allow:

Brokers

Prop firms

Mini Apps

Web3 platforms

To integrate:

Presence missions

HumanScore

Rewards

Anti-farm logic

$BWAVE token utility (post-TGE)

🧱 Vision

To make presence a new form of value on TON — enabling apps, brokers, games, and global platforms to verify, reward, and build systems around real humans, not bots.

Bluewave is building TON’s Human Presence Layer, a missing infrastructure category that the ecosystem urgently needs.
